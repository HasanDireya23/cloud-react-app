## About tailwind CSS
### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development created by Adam Wathan, Jonathan Reinink, David Hemphill and Steve Schoger.

### What is a utility-first CSS framework?

A utility-first CSS framework is one that gives you low-level utility classes that you can combine to create complex components, rather than opinionated pre-built components. This approach gives you complete control over the look and feel of your site, and makes it easy to adapt designs from other sites and libraries.

Tailwind CSS is designed with a mobile-first approach, meaning that it starts with small screen sizes and scales up from there. This is in contrast to most CSS frameworks, which start with large screen sizes and scale down.
